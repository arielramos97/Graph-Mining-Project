# Graph-Mining-Project

SD212 - Graph Mining 

The aim of this project was to build a new graph dataset from real data. For this, we used the Spotify API to create a graph where nodes represent artists and the adjacency matrix of the graph represents whether artists are related (according to Spotify).

Besides, each artist (node) has its own features extracted from 9 audio features from each of its top songs.

Finally, we performed Node Classification (14 genres) by using the APPNP model proposed in the paper:
